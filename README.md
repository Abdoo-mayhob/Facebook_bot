## General info
Self Aware Facebook post using Web Scraping and Automation with Python3 and Selenium.

### Why ?
Some Tasks/Services in Win10 and Win7 auto-run on the computer and start consuming the computer recourses. We usually head over to Task Manager and manually stop them one by one. But sometimes they auto-restart and you can't simply prevent the auto-start for some reason.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* psutil
* subprocess
* ctypes, sys


## How the code works
First, the code checks if the python script has admin privileges. If no then re-run the script with admin privileges.
The rest of the code is self explanatory.
